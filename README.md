1. [ ] Step 1: Make it that it generates file structure.
2. [ ] Step 2: Generate code for each file without pseudocode just using description.
3. [ ] Step 3: Chain of thought + recursive inclusion of filling buffer to.
4. [ ] Step 4: Intelligently include particular code snippets using pseudocode.
5. [ ] Step 5: Now that we have good code generation, need to create good harnesses for running + testing code.

File structure probably needs to be in long-term memory.
How stateless can I make writing a file as possible? I need to navigate to get this done, but I don't want to have to include everything. Knowing what to expect to import is good

Need to keep track of what the package-manager installs will be is important. So like another storage area, and then at the end just rn those installs so that they get added to the package.json or the venv? Only begin with support for npm or yarn, with python being seperate, and not allowing cross support.
